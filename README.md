# Dr-Strange-Adventure
OSU CS 162 final project in which I built a text-based adventure game in C++. 

To play the game:

 -Clone the repo to your local machine</br>
 -Run ```make game``` from a command line tool</br>
 -Enjoy :-)</br>

And...spoiler alert! In case you need some hints, I have included steps to win the game in the "Key to solving game logics" section in Reflection.pdf, but I am confident you will not get stuck :-)
