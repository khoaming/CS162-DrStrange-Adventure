# Dr-Strange-Adventure
OSU CS 162 final project in which I built a text-based adventure game in C++. 

To play the game:
1-Clone the repo to your local machine
2-Run ```make game``` from a command line tool
3-Enjoy :-)

And...spoiler alert! In case you need some hints, I have included steps to win the game in the "Key to solving game logics" section in Reflection.pdf, but I am confident you will not get stuck :-)
