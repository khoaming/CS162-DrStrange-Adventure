# Dr-Strange-Adventure
OSU CS 162 final project in which I built a text-based adventure game in C++. In order to play the game, clone the repo to your local machine and run ```make game``` from a command line tool. Enjoy :-)

And...spoiler alert! In case you need some hints, I have included steps to win the game in the "Key to solving game logics" section in Reflection.pdf, but I am confident you will not get stuck :-)
